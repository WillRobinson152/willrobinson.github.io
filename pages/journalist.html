              <p><em>"This reporting exposed a problematic effort to privatize downtown parking in Jacksonville, bringing scrutiny where none previously existed. It’s a fine example of the impact local watchdog journalism can bring, and of change that wouldn’t have been possible without the reporting in this entry."</em></p>

              <h4>Founding CEO of incentive-winning company accused of embezzlement</h4>
              <p>After acquiring several IT and software services companies, SharedLabs touted strong profits and forecasted a bright future that included an initial public offering. It threatened to take its success elsewhere if state and city taxpayers did not offer incentives, which it was then awarded.</p>
              <p>Soon after, Robinson reported on an internal company investigation into SharedLabs' founder and CEO, Jason Cory, who the company accused of embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars, even as his company failed to make payroll. Robinson also uncovered that Cory had been accused of the same behavior at previous companies and that some of the money allegedly embezzled from SharedLabs had gone to the re-election campaign of Jacksonville's mayor while SharedLabs was soliciting incentives.</p>
              <p>Following Robinson's reporting, SharedLabs forfeited its incentives, lost an attempted reverse merger that would have taken the company public, fired several executives and was sued by some of its shareholders. Cory was later arrested by the FBI and ultimately pleaded guilty to tax evasion and sentenced to two years and eight months in federal prison.</p>

              <p>Jacksonville-based CSX Corp., one of the nation's largest railroads, undertook a massive operational pivot that refocused the company on efficiency, spurring it to shed assets, cut jobs, shrink its footprint, run fewer and longer trains and undertake a host of other changes. The company's profitability soared, but the transition was hardly smooth.</p>
              <p>Robinson covered a wave of customer outcries against deteriorating service, an increase in train derailments and accidents and a second wave of customer outcries against rate and fee increases.</p>
              <p>His coverage was the first to identify the cause of a fatal collision between Amtrak and CSX trains, the only to compare the disparate service metrics CSX presented to investors and regulators and the most comprehensive of a multi-day federal hearing in Washington, D.C. over railroads' surging fees.</p>
