                <h1>Journalist</h1>
                <p>While earning his journalism degree from the University of Georgia, Robinson interned for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the Atlanta Business Chronicle and Fast Copy News Service, a freelance company through which Robinson was published in Gulfshore Business Magazine, the AJC and Engineering Georgia.</p>
                <p>After graduating, Robinson became the logistics, technology and finance reporter at the Jacksonville Business Journal. In this role, he reported on a major operational transformation at a hedge-fund-controlled railroad, a major project to deepen Jacksonville's shipping channel and the emergence of Jacksonville as a hub for liquefied natural gas exports and martitime use.</p>
                <p>Robinson also took on several investigative projects, including an exposé on a real estate developer repeatedly accused of fraud, theft and dangerous property neglect, a detailed look at an increase in train derailments and work-related injuries following thousands of layoffs at a Fortune-500 railroad, and a series on a city incentive-winning company that accused its CEO of embezzling money, among others.</p>
                <p>During this period, Robinson received an Honorable Mention for Transportation Reporting from the Society for the Advancement of Business Editing and Writing. SABEW later named him a Goldschmidt Fellow, allowing him to train in financial reporting at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. He also earned 2nd place recognition for Business Beat Reporting from the Florida chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists.</p>
                <p>Robinson then became the real estate and economic development reporter at the JBJ, where he covered redevelopment efforts in downtown Jacksonville, commercial real estate deals and trends, the financial impacts of Covid lockdowns, Paycheck Protection Program loan disbursements and more. While in this role, Robinson received a Bronze award for Best Weekly Newspaper Real Estate Story from the National Association of Real Estate Editors and won Best in Business for Government Reporting from SABEW. For his government reporting award, judges wrote:</p>
                <blockquote><em>"This reporting exposed a problematic effort to privatize downtown parking in Jacksonville, bringing scrutiny where none previously existed. It’s a fine example of the impact local watchdog journalism can bring, and of change that wouldn’t have been possible without the reporting in this entry."</em></blockquote>
                <p>Robinson is now a senior editor at OPIS, a Dow Jones company, where he covers natural gas liquids.</p>
